                        <h2>Why ETF?</h2>
                        <p>Exchange-Traded Funds are a popular investment choice because they offer diversification, low fees and flexibility. By holding a basket of assets — like stocks or bonds — ETFs help spread risk, making them suitable for both beginners and experienced investors. They trade like stocks on an exchange, allowing investors to buy or sell throughout the day, often with lower costs. With broad market exposure and easy accesibility, ETFs are a smart way to build a balanced portfolio.</p>

                        <h2>Why Bond?</h2>
                        <p>Bonds are a reliable investment option because they offer steady income, lower risk and portfolio stability. Bonds are generally less volatile than stocks, making them ideal for conservative investors. They also help diversify a portfolio, reducing overall risk and cushioning against stock market fluctuations.</p>

                        <h2>Why Cryptocurrency?</h2>
                        <p>Cryptocurrency attracts investors due to its high growth potential, decentralization and innovation. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies operate on blockchain technology which offers transparency and security without relying on banks or governments. While it's more volatile than traditional assets, the chance for significant returns and its role in emrging technologies like DeFi and NFTs make cryptocurrency and appealing option for those with a higher risk tolerance.</p>
